1. Introduction
===============

RNAFeatures computes two measures of RNA features:
- co-transcriptional effect measures: Cis and Trans.
- gene selection measures: class of bases and rate of substitution for each class.

2. Theory
=========

The establishment of this theory is not my work.
If you are interested in the theory, please read following papers:

"Co-transcriptional folding is encoded within RNA genes" 
(http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/5/10/)
written by Irmtraud M Meyer and Istvan Miklos.

"An Analysis of Structural Influences on Selection in RNA Genes"
(http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/26/1/209.full.pdf)
written by Naila K. Mimouni, Rune B. Lyngso, Sam Griffiths-Jones and Jotun Hein.

"Moments of the Boltzmann distribution for RNA secondary structures"
(http://ramet.elte.hu/~miklosi/MiklosMeyerNagy.pdf)
written by Istvan Miklos, Irmtraud M. Meyer and Borbala Nagy.

3. Usage
========

This package includes both a library and executable program to compute above features of RNA sequences.

3.1. Installation
=================

Please read INSTALL for details.

3.2. Invocation
===============

RNAFeatures [options] [filename]

RNAFeatures takes a file name, which containing a RNA sequence, as an input.

Available command line options can be checked by following command:

RNAFeatures -h

You can test RNAFeatures on one of the example RNA sequences in a directory 
called "examples":

e.g. RNAFeatures example/tRNA_seq

e.g. RNAFeatures -g example/tRNA_seq

3.3. Output
===========

RNAFeatures outputs following:
- length of sequence
- base pairs and closing loop
- sequence
- parenthesis structure
- MFE
- Cis and Trans
- classes of each bases
- The expected energy of the RNA secondary structure
- The variance of the energy of the RNA secondary structure
- MFE log probability of the RNA sequence

Please feel free to contact the author for bug-reports, feature-requests, 
suggestions and etc. Of course I also look forward to hearing from you if 
you discovered something biologically interesting things using coTransFold.
